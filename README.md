Object-Oriented-Programming-C++-Concepts
🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in C++
This repository demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in C++ through various code examples. It provides detailed explanations and practical implementations of OOP principles such as Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation. This repository is ideal for students and developers who want to understand the fundamental concepts of OOP in C++.

🎯 Objective
Provide clear examples of fundamental OOP concepts in C++.

Help learners understand and apply OOP principles effectively.

Implement practical examples to demonstrate inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

🛠️ Methodology
🔍 Core OOP Concepts
Classes and Objects: Learn the basics of creating classes and objects.

Constructors and Destructors: Understand how constructors initialize objects and destructors clean up resources.

Inheritance: Extend classes to create reusable and maintainable code.

Polymorphism: Use method overloading and overriding to implement dynamic behavior.

Encapsulation: Encapsulate data and methods, restricting direct access to class members.

Abstraction: Hide implementation details and expose only essential functionalities.

📄 File Structure
Core OOP Concepts: Each concept has a separate file, which explains and demonstrates that concept.

class_and_objects.cpp: Demonstrates the creation of classes and objects.

constructor_destructor.cpp: Covers the use of constructors and destructors.

inheritance.cpp: Shows how inheritance works in C++.

polymorphism.cpp: Demonstrates runtime polymorphism using function overriding.

encapsulation.cpp: Shows how to implement encapsulation in C++.

abstraction.cpp: Demonstrates how to implement abstraction with abstract classes and virtual functions.

🎓 Tech Stack
C++: Primary programming language used for implementing OOP concepts.

G++ (GNU Compiler): Used for compiling and running the C++ code.

Visual Studio Code or Code::Blocks: Recommended IDE for writing and compiling the C++ code.

📊 Results
OOP Concept	Description

Inheritance	Demonstrated class extension, reusability, and method overriding.
Polymorphism	Implemented method overloading and overriding for runtime polymorphism.
Encapsulation	Illustrated how to protect data using access specifiers.
Abstraction	Used pure virtual functions and abstract classes to hide implementation details.
